based on what is saw in the website , it seems like you're experiencing an issue with button sizes on the website.
I can see that there are several buttons used throughout the website, including:
Navigation buttons (e.g., "Home", "About", "Service", etc.)
Call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Donation", "Learn More", etc.)
Social media buttons (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.)
